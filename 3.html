        Korean dramas, more popularly known as K-dramas, are television series 
        in the Korean language, made in South Korea.

        Korean dramas are popular worldwide, especially in Asia, partially due to 
        the spread of Korean popular culture (the "Korean Wave"), and their widespread 
        availability via streaming services which often offer subtitles in multiple languages. 
        Many K-dramas have been adapted throughout the world, and some have had great impact 
        on other countries. Some of the most famous dramas have been broadcast via traditional 
        television channels in other countries. For example, Dae Jang Geum (2003) was sold to 
        150 countries.[1]

        Korean dramas have attracted international attention for their fashion, style and culture. 
        The rise in popularity of Korean dramas had led to a great boost to fashion lines. 
        However, various Korean dramas have also been criticized for their attempts to take 
        advantage of such popularity to distort, rewrite or whitewash Korea's history, especially 
        during South Korea's dictatorship regimes or the nation's historical periods.[2][3] 
        As they constitute an important aspect of South Korea's soft power projection to "brand 
        and publicize" the country, some K-dramas have also been criticized by Korean nationalists 
        who feel that do not adequately "glorify the nation" enough.
