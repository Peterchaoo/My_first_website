        Korean pop music other than idol music is called  “Gayo,” in general — even though there are more sophisticated and detailed sub-genres within it. <br>
        Meanwhile, the articles also define K-pop as 1) “a fictitious concept that aims to become a 
        transnational popular music and in this process ‘K’ transformed into a brand name for exporting goods” (Lee, 2016) 
        and 2) state that  “K-pop, or Korean idol pop, was the first time in the history of Korean pop music 
        to be a genre of music that was planned/produced for the world market, while the first case that was being given 
        their identity from outside, not inside” (Kim, 2017).
