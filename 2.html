        Hollywood films may dominate the world’s box offices today, 
        but in Korea it’s the homegrown product that has been capturing 
        the public’s attention. Korean films enjoyed a 52% share of the 
        domestic market in 2011, putting them over the fifty-percent mark for 
        the first time in four years. It was the most prolific year for Korean 
        filmmaking yet in the 21st century – 216 new movies. Meanwhile, Korean 
        film directors were getting major press at international film festivals. 
        Exports were booming, and the films that reached overseas audiences found 
        a warm reception there. Exported films netted some $15,830,000 that 
        year, reversing a six-year trend of negative growth. Their number – 366 – 
        was also at a historic high.
